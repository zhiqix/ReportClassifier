# ChatReport: Intelligent Research Report Writing System Based on Multi-Agent Collaboration

### INTRODUCTION

This project aims to achieve the extraction of financial causal knowledge. We extracted causal knowledge from over 500,000 financial research reports. Several samples of these reports are showcased in the 'report_sample' directory, and the extracted causal knowledge is presented in the 'output' directory.

### Libraries needed

- scikit_learn
- torch
- transformers

### Usage

1. When you want to train the model, you can run  `python train.py`.
2. When you want to extract causal knowledge from certain research reports, you can run `python classify.py`.
